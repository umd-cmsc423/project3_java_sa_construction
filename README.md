# project3_java_sa_construction

This repository provides a suffix array construction implementation you can use for Project 3. The implementation is of a linear-time suffix array construction algorithm, originally found 
at [https://github.com/v-v/karkkainen-sanders](https://github.com/v-v/karkkainen-sanders), released under GPL v2, and due to Miranda Krekovic.  You are free to use this implementation of SA construction as the basis 
for building your FM index.
